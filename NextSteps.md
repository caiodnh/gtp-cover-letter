- fill up the base cover letters using xml tags
- adapt the latex creation to use the right folder
 - perhaps ``cover-letters/company_job_date``
- make the forms talk with the base cover letters
- make one of the forms names be ``position``, another ``hiring manager (if known)`` and a third ``job ad``
- centralize the forms
